Introduction: The main focus of our project aims to do an analysis of Twitter data regarding the use/gameplay of Pokemon Go and create a form of data visualization. Our team set out to explore the relationship between people playing Pokemon Go and what their relationship with the game looks like through Twitter over the course of a month.

Methods: To gather twitter data our team made a Python script that used twitters streaming API to stream the data as it arrives on twitter straight into a file that holds the data on our computer. Streaming only the tweets with #PokemonGo. While the data was being streamed in it provided given a user, tweet, and time tag which was later used to help parse the data. Using additional Python, Bash and R scripts were used alongside tags and select words given in data to organize and thoroughly parse through it.


Conclusion: In conclusion, our studies found a relationship between people playing PokemonGo and how they interact with it, such as what they care about, what the most popular Pokemon is and why that is, as well as what times people prefer to play Pokemon Go. Looking at the pie chart and the word cloud we find a correlation with twitter activity and shiny Pokemon as well as Pokemon being featured on Community Day events over the course of a month. There was also an unexpected correlation between PokemonGo and PKG tokens which is a form of crypto currency that can be earned from within the game and the community events.

Frequency Chart: 
This data was acquired from tweets streamed over the course of a month with use of a Python script to stream them and a Bash script to save them in a file and parse out the relevant time data. From this chart we can conclude that PokemonGo Twitter activity is at it's highest during the evening times of day; peaking around 7:00 p.m. (19:00). Presumably due to a majority of Twitter users tweeting about PokemonGo becoming more active when there is more leisure time (after school, work, etc.).

Word Cloud:
To make this word cloud we used tweets streamed from twitter with the PokemonGo hashtag. An R script was used to parse the with a stop list and word transformation using the text mining package which was then made into a word cloud with the wordcloud package. From the word cloud we found that there is a unexpected high amount of Twitter activity surrounding PokemonGo and a cryptocurrency known as pkg token. We can determined that this cryptocurrency is in high demand even more when events are held. Also, there is a ton of activity regarding capturing legendary shiny Pokemon that are released during Community Day events with PokemonGo.

Pie Chart: 
To make this pie chart we made a Bash script that made a list of each word from all the tweets, sorted them based on occurrences with the number of occurrences next to the word, and then picked the top ten most popular Pokemon. From this pie chart we can conclude that Pikachu is the most tweeted about Pokemon, this makes sense as it is the franchises mascot. One of the more surprising things discovered was the popularity of Mareep. This is perhaps tied to a PokemonGo Community Day event that took place while we were streaming tweets.
