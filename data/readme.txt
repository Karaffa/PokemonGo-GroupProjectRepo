These are the data dumps from twitter. They are probably out of date as of right now.

The file where the stream that includes time is used is called timedtwitterdump.txt.

The file where search was used is called searchtwitterdump.txt.

These are here right now mostly to test the visualization.


Important: timeparse.txt is the fully parsed out time data sorted by occurance with occurance being the number in the first column and the hour being the second column
