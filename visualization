Methods: To gather our twitter data we made a python script that used twitters streaming API to stream the data as it arrives on twitter straight into a file that holds the data on our computer. We streamed only the tweets from #pokemongo. While the data was being streamed in it was given a user, tweet, and time tag. This was to help us parse the data. To parse the data we used Python, Bash and R scripts which took advantage of the tags given to the data to parse it accurately.

Conclusions: PokemonGo

Pie Chart: 
Method: To make this pie chart we made a Bash script that made a list of each word from all the tweets, sorted them based on occurances with the number of occurences next to the word, and then picked the top ten most popular Pokemon.  

Interpertation: From this pie chart we can conclude that Pikachu is the most tweeted about Pokemon, this makes sense as it is the franchises mascot. Mew being second most talked about is most likely related to a new feature Niantic released that allows players to complete objectives for a chance to catch Mew. One of the more surprising things we found was the popularity of Mareep. This is perhaps tied to a PokemonGo Community Day event that took place while we were streaming tweets.
